# FiraLogic

I had a little bit of free time this thanksgiving break, and I wanted to:

1. learn a little more about font rendering;
2. make a nice open-source font for [Carnap](http://carnap.io), with support for glyphs used in logical notation and with ligatures for ascii combinations that commonly stand for those glyphs.

So, I started with the most recent iteration of [Fira Mono](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/), added some relevant glyphs from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), created a few more, and filled in some code points that the Fira family was missing. Thus was born: Fira Logic.
