# FiraLogic

I had a little bit of free time this thanksgiving break, and I wanted to:

1. learn a little more about font rendering;
2. make a nice open-source font for Carnap, with support for glyphs used in logical notation and with ligatures for ascii combinations that commonly stand for those glyphs.

So, I started with the most recent iteration of Fira Mono, added some relevant glyphs from Fira Code, created a few more, and filled in some code points that the Fira family was missing. Thus was born: Fira Logic.
